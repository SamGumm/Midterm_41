        <!--Plan is to have either:
                a) A card view much like Activity05
                    - This would require having State JSON objects
                        with relevant information
                        
                                -or-

                b) A menu similar to Activity08
                    - This would also require having State JSON objects
                        with relevant info.

                                -or-

                c) Something else...
        
            
            Also need:
                - Navigation bar
                - background?
                - ...
        
        
            -->
